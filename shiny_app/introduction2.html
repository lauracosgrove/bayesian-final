<h1>Motivation</h1>
<p>For population inference based on an analysis of many n-of-1 trials, the choice of method should best fit the features that motivate the choice of and design of n-of-1 trials, namely, the presence of heterogeneity in individual treatment effects, and important design considerations such as the presence of period effects and autocorrelation. A discussion and theoretical advancement of the importance of simulating data that account for the features that randomization – in this case, period effects and treatment by patient interaction—was elegantly put forth by Araujo et al. (2016). The recommendations of Araujo et al. are summarized in the following: in the presence of treatment-by-patient heterogeneity and period heterogeneity, it is always valid and recommended to use a random effects model accounting for the above sources of variation, and when only summary measures are present it is also valid to use a random effects meta-analysis model for estimation. However, for simply testing the strict null hypothesis of no treatment effect, treatment interaction by patient can be ignored, and either matched-pair t tests or fixed effect meta-analysis can be used.</p>
<p>Why do we think there is treatment-by-patient heterogeneity? In the n-of-1 trial setting, there should be lack of certainty about whether previously published results and recommendations about treatments are applicable to a given patient. Therefore, it is likely that the treatment effect is not the same for every patient.</p>
<p>Why would we want to estimate the true variance of the treatment effect? While Araujo et al. do not discuss Bayesian hierarchical models, Empirical Bayes estimates are discussed in a further important conclusion advancing the use of a mixed-model approach to estimate the variance of the treatment effect. That is, if one were to use the results of the n-of-1 meta-analysis to treat future patients, one can use the estimated treatment effect mean and the treatment effect variance to improve the interim treatment effect estimates for a patient using the Empirical Bayes method for example after one cycle. A fully Bayesian treatment may also be used for future patients; the essential ingredient is that the heterogeneity (i.e., variance) of the treatment effect is estimated with the meta-analysis.</p>

<h1>Model for Simulating a Series of n-of-1 trials</h1>
<p>As a guide, I construct the simulation study in the assumed setting of a meta-analysis of the PREEMPT study of chronic pain (Barr et. al, 2016), whose design but not result has been published, attending to important features of the design and data in order to construct my simulation dataset assuming that the question of interest is the true population treatment effect of one treatment contrasted against one other (though the PREEMPT study is designed to choose two of many different treatment options for a patient based on clinician judgment).</p>
<p>The model is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_{irs} = \lambda_i + \beta_{ir} + \epsilon_{irs} + Z_{irs}\tau_i\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(Y_{irs}\)</span> is the measured outcome for occasion s, <span class="math inline">\(s = 1, 2\)</span> of cycle r, <span class="math inline">\(r = 1, 2, .... k\)</span> for patient i, <span class="math inline">\(i = 1, 2, n\)</span>, and:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\lambda_i \sim N(\Lambda, \phi^2)\)</span>: Patient-specific mean of the outcome, drawn from a normal distribution with population mean of <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\beta_{ir} \sim N(0, \gamma^2)\)</span> : Within patient, within cycle (block) random noise</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{irs} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)</span> : Within patient, within cycle (block), within occassion (independent of treatment) random noise</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\tau_{i} \sim N(T, \psi^2)\)</span>: Where <span class="math inline">\(Z_{irs}\)</span> takes values <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> when the occassion <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> has treatment A and <span class="math inline">\(-\frac{1}{2}\)</span> when occassion <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> has treatment B, the patient-specific for treatment effect, drawn from a normal population mean treatment effect of T. Therefore, an estimate for HTE (heterogeneity of treatment effect) is <span class="math inline">\(\psi^2\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Some reasonable values have been chosen as defaults from the power analysis part of the preregistered PREEMPT trial, though I encourage the viewer to mess around with them, and particularly check out the results when the estimated true treatment by patient heterogeneity is 0:</p>
<p>“The sample size required for the proposed RCT is based on the primary outcome: change from baseline to 26 weeks on the PROMIS pain interference scale. Assuming that the minimally important difference is 0.4 SD difference (4 points) (…) Assuming a common standard deviation of 10 points, each group (Trialist app and usual care) would need to include 122 patients (244 in total) in order to have 80% power to detect a 3.6-point difference in means using a 2-group t-test with a 0.05 2-sided significance level.”</p>
<p>Reference: PROMIS scores have a mean of 50 and standard deviation (SD) of 10 in a clinically relevant referent population.</p>

<div id="mixed-effects-model" class="section level2">
<h2>Mixed Effects Model</h2>
<p>The mixed effect model is the same as the underlying model that generated the data, and is fit on all data. We recover our parameter values in the mixed effects model as follows:</p>
<p><code>lme4::lmer(Y ~ 1 + Z + (1|id:cycle) + (Z|id) , data = df_rand)</code></p>
<ul>
<li><p>We set <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_i \sim N(\Lambda, \phi^2)\)</span>, the patient-specific mean of the outcome, drawn from a normal distribution with population mean of <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span>. In the model, the corresponding estimate in the variance of the outcome is under the estimated standard deviation of the random effect of the individual id.</p></li>
<li><p>We set <span class="math inline">\(\Lambda\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\lambda_i \sim N(\Lambda, \phi^2)\)</span>. In the model, the corresponding estimate in the mean of the outcome is under the fixed effects intercept term.</p></li>
<li><p>We set <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\beta_{ir} \sim N(0, \gamma^2)\)</span>, the within patient, within cycle (block) random noise. In the model, the corresponding estimate in the mean of the outcome is under the estimated standard deviation of the nested random effect, <code>id:cycle</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>We set <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{irs} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)\)</span>, the within patient, within cycle (block), within occassion (independent of treatment) random noise: in the model, it is the estimated standard deviation of the residual random effect.</p></li>
<li><p>We set T in <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{i} \sim N(T, \psi^2)\)</span>, the population average treatment effect. In the model, it is estimated under the fixed effects slope term for Z.</p></li>
<li><p>We set <span class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\tau_{i} \sim N(T, \psi^2)\)</span>, the heterogeneity of treatment effect. In the model, it is estimated under the estimated standard deviation of the random effects slope term of Z by treatment.</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="matched-pairs-t-test" class="section level2">
<h2>Matched Pairs T Test</h2>
<p>The matched pair t-test is performed on each pair of within-cycle treatment outcomes for each patient, and the <span class="math inline">\(nk\)</span> matched outcomes are treated as independent. Note that here, and for the summary measures approach for meta-analysis, if there were multiple measurements per cycle the mean of each treatment within cycle was taken as the pair difference. I.e.:</p>
<p><code>t.test(D$A, D$B, paired = TRUE)</code></p>
<p>Araujo et al. showed that while the matched pair t test of within-cycle differences was powerful for rejecting the sharp null hypothesis of treatment equality, if the objective is to estimate treatment effect, the matched pair t-test is biased toward lower variance in the presence of treatment by patient heterogeneity.</p>
</div>
<div id="random-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Random Effects Meta Analysis</h2>
<p>Unlike the previous two approaches, in the meta-analysis realm, it is assumed that one does not have access to the n-of-1 studies’ raw data, but rather summary measures for each study For both random and fixed effects meta-analysis, Araujo et al. showed that that the summary measures of the mean and variance of within cycle differences for n-of-1 studies, the <em>basic estimator</em> approach, estimate the average treatment effect and variance of the treatment effect (treatment heterogeneity) correctly.</p>
<p>When random effects meta-analysis is performed on these summary measures, the following function from the <code>metafor</code> package is used:</p>
<p><code>metafor::rma.uni(dat$d_mean, dat$d_var, method = "REML")</code></p>
<p>Both “total treatment heterogeneity” and the treatment effect is estimated. I take the total treatment heterogeneity estimate as that of heterogeneity of treatment effect, although it is not decomposed into the individual components as in the mixed effects model.</p>
</div>
<div id="fixed-effects-meta-analysis" class="section level2">
<h2>Fixed Effects Meta Analysis</h2>
<p>When fixed effects meta-analysis is performed on these summary measures, the method is changed:</p>
<p><code>metafor::rma.uni(dat$d_mean, dat$d_var, method = "FE")</code></p>
<p>The treatment effect is estimated, as is a confidence interval. Araujo et al. discuss that fixed effects meta-analysis may be used, as with the matched pairs T, to reject the sharp null in the presence of treatment by patient heterogeneity, but it has similar problems with estimation.</p>
